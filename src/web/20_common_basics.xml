      <!-- Code for oauth allows GET as an unchecked development path,
           but since GET requests are by default fully logged with their
           arguments by our server and by any proxies, we don't want
           our clients to use it by mistake. Blocking GET should expose
           such behavioral regressions early, during CI testing.
           If some developer needs to test with GET, they can comment
           the method line below in their local build/deployment.
           Note that the fty-core::weblib.sh uses POST since long ago. -->
